Here, it is demonstrated that reliable high-energy grazing-incidence total X-ray scattering data can be obtained {\it in situ} during thin-film deposition by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. A benchmark system of Pt was investigated in a novel sputtering chamber mounted on beamline P07-EH2 at the PETRA III synchrotron. Robust and high-quality PDFs can be obtained from films as thin as 3nm and atomistic modelling of the PDFs with a time resolution of 0.5s is possible. In this way, it was found that a polycrystalline Pt thin film deposits with random orientation at 8W and 2 {$\times$} 10${\sp {$-$}2}$mbar at room temperature. From the PDF it was found that the coherent-scattering domains grow with time. While the first layers are formed with a small tensile strain this relaxes towards the bulk value with increasing film thickness.},

	Oxygen activity in highly delithiated LiCoO2 is critical to fully utilizing the energy density of this high-tap-density cathode but still lacks a clear understanding. In this work, we combined the results of several experimental techniques, especially resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and neutron pair distribution function (NPDF) analysis, together with theoretical calculations to study this topic. Our results conclude that oxygen redox takes place globally in the lattice, rather than forming localized dimerization as previously thought. RIXS results directly reveal the reversible oxygen redox, and NPDF results show that the O–O pair distance is considerably shortened in the highly delithiated LiCoO2. Theoretical calculations indicate that no O–O bonding is formed in LiCoO2, in sharp contrast to the lithium-rich system in which O–O bonding does form. These results provide the rationale for achieving a reversible deep delithiation and high energy density for LiCoO2-based electrodes.}

	The key to fabricating complex, hierarchical materials is the control of chemical reactions at various length scales. To this end, the classical model of nucleation and growth fails to provide sufficient information. Here, we illustrate how modern X-ray spectroscopic and scattering in situ studies bridge the molecular- and macro- length scales for assemblies of polyhedrally shaped CoO nanocrystals. Utilizing high energy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we directly access the molecular level of the nanomaterial synthesis. We reveal that initially Co(acac)
	3
	rapidly reduces to square-planar Co(acac)
	2
	and coordinates to two solvent molecules. Combining atomic pair distribution functions and small-angle X-ray scattering we observe that, unlike a classical nucleation and growth mechanism, nuclei as small as 2 nm assemble into superstructures of 20 nm. The individual nanoparticles and assemblies continue growing at a similar pace. The final spherical assemblies are smaller than 100 nm, while the nanoparticles reach a size of 6 nm and adopt various polyhedral, edgy shapes. Our work thus provides a comprehensive perspective on the emergence of nano-assemblies in solution.},

Here, atomic pair distribution function, a method to study the local atomic arrangement on the basis of average spectroscopic information, is used for the ﬁrst time to study the local structure evolution of Li2MnO3 during electrochemical charge/discharge cycles. The results clearly demonstrate that Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple is activated and Mn ions are reduced during discharging process. Some Mn ions in Mn layers can signiﬁcantly migrate to Li layers and occupy the octahedral sites. As a result, a portion of inserted Li ions can occupy the face-shared tetrahedron sites, accompanied by the formation of local spinel-like structure.

Unlike in the bulk state, where various structurally unknown phases have been identified through their specific physical properties, a number of intermediate phases in the thin-film state remain largely unexplored. Here, {\it in situ} X-ray diffraction and X-ray total scattering are combined with {\it in situ} measurement of electrical resistivity to monitor the crystallization process of as-deposited amorphous Zn-Sb films during post-deposition annealing. The as-deposited Zn-Sb films undergo a structural evolution from an amorphous phase to an intermediate crystalline phase and finally the ZnSb phase during heat treatment up to 573K. An intermediate phase (phase B) is identified to be a modified {$\beta$}-Zn${\sb 8}$Sb${\sb 7}$ phase by refinement of the X-ray diffraction data. Within a certain range of Sb content ({$\sim$}42{--}55at%) in the films, phase B is accompanied by an emerging Sb impurity phase. Lower Sb content leads to smaller amounts of Sb impurity and the formation of phase B at lower temperatures, and phase B is stable at room temperature if the annealing temperature is controlled. Pair distribution function analysis of the amorphous phase shows local ordered units of distorted ZnSb${\sb 4}$ tetrahedra, and annealing leads to long-range ordering of these units to form the intermediate phase. A higher formation energy is required when the intermediate phase evolves into the ZnSb phase with a significantly more regular arrangement of ZnSb${\sb 4}$ tetrahedra.},

	The development of new functional materials builds on an understanding of the intricate relationship between material structure and properties, and structural characterization is a crucial part of materials chemistry. However, elucidating the atomic structure of nanomaterials remains a challenge using conventional diffraction techniques due to the lack of long-range atomic order. Over the past decade, Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis of X-ray or neutron total scattering data has become a mature and well-established method capable of giving insight into the atomic structure in nanomaterials. Here, we review the use of PDF analysis and modelling in characterization of a range of different nanomaterials that exhibit unique atomic structure compared to the corresponding bulk materials. A brief introduction to PDF analysis and modelling is given, followed by examples of how essential structural information can be extracted from PDFs using both model-free and advanced modelling methods. We put an emphasis on how the intuitive nature of the PDF can be used for understanding important structural motifs, and on the diversity of applications of PDF analysis to nanostructure problems.},

Today, the PDF approach is an integral part of research on amorphous, nanocrystalline and disordered materials from bulk to nanoparticle size. Thin films, however, demand specific experimental strategies for enhanced surface sensitivity and sophisticated data treatment to obtain high-quality PDF data. The approach described here is based on the surface high-energy X-ray diffraction technique applying photon energies above 60keV at grazing incidence. In this way, reliable PDFs were extracted from films of thicknesses down to a few nanometres. Compared with recently published reports on thin-film PDF analysis from both transmission and grazing-incidence geometries, this work brought the minimum detectable film thickness down by about a factor of ten. Depending on the scattering power of the sample, the data acquisition on such ultrathin films can be completed within fractions of a second. Hence, the rapid-acquisition grazing-incidence PDF method is a major advancement in thin-film technology that opens unprecedented possibilities for {\it in situ} and {\it operando} PDF studies in complex sample environments. By uncovering how the structure of a layered material on a substrate evolves and transforms in terms of local and average ordering, this technique offers new opportunities for understanding processes such as nucleation, growth, morphology evolution, crystallization and the related kinetics on the atomic level and in real time.},

          , 
            The development of new functional materials builds on an understanding of the intricate relationship between material structure and properties, and structural characterization is a crucial part of materials chemistry. However, elucidating the atomic structure of nanomaterials remains a challenge using conventional diffraction techniques due to the lack of long-range atomic order. Over the past decade, Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis of X-ray or neutron total scattering data has become a mature and well-established method capable of giving insight into the atomic structure in nanomaterials. Here, we review the use of PDF analysis and modelling in characterization of a range of different nanomaterials that exhibit unique atomic structure compared to the corresponding bulk materials. A brief introduction to PDF analysis and modelling is given, followed by examples of how essential structural information can be extracted from PDFs using both model-free and advanced modelling methods. We put an emphasis on how the intuitive nature of the PDF can be used for understanding important structural motifs, and on the diversity of applications of PDF analysis to nanostructure problems.},

Preferred orientation can cause serious systematic errors in both quantitative phase analysis and crystal structure determination.

Therefore, it was recommended to use the GSH for correction of the preferred orientation in XRD and neutron diffraction analysis for both crystal structure refinement and quantitative phase analysis. In the present study, the GSH description has been extended to describe crystal structure and texture in the XRD data of scale deposits formed in an amine trim cooler. The results revealed that the structural refinement parameters obtained from the Rietveld refinement with the GSH agreed well with the corresponding single crystal structure. Additionally, the GSH description provides better results for the materials investigated in the present study than the March model. Therefore, the GSH approach should be used for preferred orientation correction in XRD Rietveld analysis, for both crystal structure refinement and phase composition analyses.},

A convenient procedure is to approximate this profile with a function whose variable parameters are fit during least-squares structure refinement. Several functions have previously been suggested but without theoretical justification. The present study reviews the derivation of this method and examines its assumptions and applications. The several proposed functions are compared with each other and with the March function which describes the pole-density distribution produced by rigid-body rotation of inequant crystallites (i.e. crystallites with unequal sides) upon axially symmetric volume-conserving compression or expansion. For its basis, ease of use, single variable parameter, direct interpretability and good refinement test results, the March distribution is proposed as an advantageous pole-density profile function for general use.},

	abstract = {Theoretical concepts and the practical application of the three-dimensional pair distribution function (3D-PDF) method and its variant, the three-dimensional Δ-pair distribution function (3D-ΔPDF) method, are presented. In analogy to traditional Patterson function analysis, advantage is taken of the Fourier transformation either of the full three-dimensional diffraction pattern of a disordered crystal or just of the isolated diffuse scattering, respectively. By the use of three-dimensional information, analysis of disorder becomes straightforward, and it becomes possible to investigate far more complicated structures than is feasible with well established powder diffraction-based PDF analysis. Compared to more traditional modelling techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulation, the 3D-ΔPDF provides direct access to disorder models and allows selective modelling of distinct structural features, which are, in contrast to reciprocal space, well localized in PDF space. The principles of the 3D-ΔPDF approach are exemplified using an analysis of the twofold (∼8 Å) periodic superstructure of a decagonal Al

The superstructure is found to be built from columnar units, having a maximum diameter of ∼14.5 Å. The lateral correlation between these columns is weak. Internally, the columns consist of a long-range-ordered alternation of flat and puckered layers. The development of the model and the atomic structure of the columns are described in detail.},

Quantitative orientational pair correlation coefficients are determined for all lateral pairs separated by less than 100 Å. A careful analysis of the factors influencing the accuracy of the 3D-ΔPDF refinement is presented. It is shown that the effect of statistical errors is small compared to systematic errors coming from diffraction geometry distortions, reciprocal space resolution or incompletely corrected background. Various strategies for identifying and decreasing systematic errors are discussed. The impact of the systematic errors on the uncertainty of the results is not just specific for 3D-ΔPDF investigations but also relevant for other quantitative diffuse scattering modeling techniques.},

              uses an

              PDFgetX3
              is written in the Python language and features a well documented reusable code base.

Volumetric data such as electron and nuclear densities, Patterson functions, and wavefunctions are displayed as isosurfaces, bird's-eye views and two-dimensional maps. Isosurfaces can be colored according to other physical quantities. Translucent isosurfaces and/or slices can be overlapped with a structural model. Collaboration with external programs enables the user to locate bonds and bond angles in the `graphics area', simulate powder diffraction patterns, and calculate site potentials and Madelung energies. Electron densities determined experimentally are convertible into their Laplacians and electronic energy densities.},

          , 
            
              Functional thin films are commonly integrated in electronic devices as part of a multi-layer architecture. Metal/oxide/metal structures
              e.g.
              in resistive switching memory and piezoelectric microelectrochemical devices are relevant applications. The films are mostly fabricated from the vapour phase or by solution deposition. Processing conditions with a limited thermal budget typically yield nanocrystalline or amorphous layers. For these aperiodic materials, the structure is described in terms of the local atomic order on the length scale of a few chemical bonds up to several nanometres. Previous structural studies of the short-range order in thin films have addressed the simple case of single coatings on amorphous substrates. By contrast, this work demonstrates how to probe the local structure of two stacked functional layers by means of grazing incidence total X-ray scattering and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The key to separating the contributions of the individual thin films is the variation of the incidence angle below the critical angle of total external reflection, In this way, structural information was obtained for functional oxides on textured electrodes,

	abstract = {Many functional materials are today synthesized in the form of nanoparticles displaying preferred orientation effects to some small or large extent. The analysis of diffraction data of such kinds of systems is best performed in the framework of the total scattering approach that prescinds from translation symmetry assumptions. Therefore modified expressions were derived for the most common total scattering functions, in particular the Debye scattering equation (DSE) which yields the texture-averaged differential cross section as a function of atomic coordinates and texture parameters. The modified DSE encodes higher-order even spherical Bessel functions which account for the texture effect. Selection rules arising from experimental geometries and symmetries are discussed. In addition the duality of the texture effect is introduced showing the effects of texture on both the

Design, construction, and main funding was the responsibility of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, HZG. Approximately 70 % of the beamtime is dedicated to Materials Research, the rest reserved for “general physics” experiments covered by DESY, Hamburg. The beamline P07 in sector 5 consists of an undulator source optimized for high energies, a white beam optics hutch, an in-house test facility and three independent experimental hutches, plus additional set-up and storage space for long-term experiments. HEMS has partly been operational since summer 2010. First experiments are introduced coming from (a) fundamental research for the investigation of the relation between macroscopic and micro-structural properties of polycrystalline materials, grain-grain-interactions, recrystallisation processes, and the development of new & smart materials or processes; (b) applied research for manufacturing process optimization benefitting from the high flux in combination with ultra-fast detector systems allowing complex and highly dynamic in-situ studies of microstructural transformations, e.g. in-situ friction stir welding; (c) experiments targeting the industrial user community.}
